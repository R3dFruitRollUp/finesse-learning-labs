## Step 4: Sign in SupervisorA to Finesse

In contact center applications (Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise or Cisco Unified Contact Center Express), users have a notion of agent state. The agent's state represents the status of the agent, similar to the status in a chat client. Finesse follows the agent state transition machine that is defined in the contact center application that it is connected to. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User — Change Agent State</a> section of the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/guides/rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> for more information.

```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S21A5A70_00_sign-in.html" target="_blank">User - Sign In to Finesse</a>

The User object represents an agent or supervisor and includes information about the user, such as roles, state, and teams. Signing in the user uses the ``/User`` REST resource with the HTTP ``PUT`` verb. In addition, we need to provide some extra information about the user (i.e. state and extension), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<User>
   <state>LOGIN</state>
   <extension>[SupervisorA's Extension]</extension>
</User>
```

In this step, you will be signing in SupervisorA using the Finesse REST API and expecting a Finesse notification with SupervisorA in NOT_READY state.

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{supervisor_username}}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter SupervisorA's username: ``{{supervisor_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter SupervisorA's password: ``{{supervisor_password}}``.
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
 ```xml
<User>
         <state>LOGIN</state>
         <extension>{{supervisor_dn}}</extension>
</User>
```

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
4. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

5. According to the agent state transition machine, when a user is successfully logged in, they will go to NOT_READY state. NOT_READY state means the user is logged in, but is not ready to take customer calls. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should see a user notification being sent from Finesse with the ``<state>`` tag value of NOT_READY. This confirms that the user was logged in successfully.

6. In the later steps of this lab, you will be working with SupervisorA's team. In order to do so, you will need the team Id, which is the value of the ``<id>`` tag from within the ``<Team>`` tag from the user notification.
 * Copy the value of the ``<id>`` tag from the user notification to a text editor.
