## Step 9: SupervisorA gets a list of subscriptions

Now that you have subscribed to get team notifications, you may want to see a list of nodes supervisorA is subscribed to.

Just like the subscription request from the previous step, getting a list of subscriptions also follow the <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html" target="_blank">XEP-0600</a> standard.

> XEP-0600 standard syntax for <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#entity-subscriptions" target="_blank">getting the list</a> of subscriptions
> ```xml
<iq type='get' from='{id}@<Finesse_FQDN>' to='pubsub.<Finesse_FQDN>' id='subList1'>
   <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
      <subscriptions/>
   </pubsub>
</iq>
```

In this step, you will get a list of supervisorA's subscriptions.

1. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, enter the following text into the input textbox at the bottom of the XMPP/XML console:
```xml
<iq type='get' from='{{supervisor_username}}@{{web-url}}' to='pubsub.{{web-url}}' id='subList1'>
      <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
          <subscriptions/>
      </pubsub>
</iq>
```

2. Push enter to send the subscription request.
3. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should see a response where the value of the ``response`` attribute of the IQ tag is ``result``. You will also see a list of ``<subscription>`` tags within the ``<subscriptions>`` tag. These are the nodes that supervisorA is subscribed to. As you can see, it contains a list of the automatically subscribed nodes as well as the team node that you subscribed to in the previous step.
