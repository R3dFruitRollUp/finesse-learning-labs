## Step 10: SupervisorA changes userA's state to not ready

Supervisors can change the state for the agents who belong to their team. They are only allowed to set the state to NOT_READY (without reason code), READY, or LOGOUT.

> Finesse API for supervisor changing the user state
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/User/{id_of_agent_on_team}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User - Change Agent State</a>

The supervisor changing the agent's state uses the same ``/User`` REST resource as an agent changing their own state. The only difference is that the supervisor will use their own credentials in the authentication. The XML data in the request Body is also the same:
```xml
<User>
     <state>[New State]</state>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, then select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter SupervisorA's username: ``{{supervisor_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter SupervisorA's password: ``{{supervisor_password}}``.
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
 ```xml
<User>
        <state>NOT_READY</state>
</User>
```

3. Click **Send** to launch the request.
4. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty Body textbox.

5. In **Pidigin**, on the XMPP console, you should see a user notification with the ``<source>`` tag of /finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}} being sent from Finesse with the ``<state>`` tag value of NOT_READY. This confirms that the supervisor successfully changed UserA's state and is also subscribed to the team notifications.
