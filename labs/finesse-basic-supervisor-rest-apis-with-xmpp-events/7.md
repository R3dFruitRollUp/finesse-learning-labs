## Step 7: SupervisorA doesn't receive team notification

UserA is configured to be part of supervisorA's team. By default, supervisorA does not receive team notifications of agent state changes because team notifications require an explicit subscription. In this step, you will confirm that userA's state change does not trigger a team notification to supervisorA.

1. In **Chrome**, go to userA's Finesse desktop window.
2. Change userA's state by clicking on **Not Ready**.
3. From the dropdown menu, select **Ready** to change userA's state to READY.

4. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should not see any notifications being sent from Finesse. This confirms that UserA's state change is not triggering a team notification to supervisorA.
