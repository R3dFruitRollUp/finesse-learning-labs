## Step 5: Get SupervisorA's Team information

> Finesse API resource for getting the team object
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/Team/{teamId}
```
> For more details about /Team, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_T846AB1E_00_team-get-team.html" target="_blank">User - Get Team</a>

The Team object contains the configuration information for a specific team, which includes the URI, the team ID, the team name, and a list of agents who are members of that team.

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
2. Construct a REST **GET** request for the ``/Team`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/Team`` resource where {teamId} is the id of the team the user supervises which you had copied to the text editor in the previous step:
   ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/Team/{teamId}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **GET**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{supervisor_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{supervisor_password}}``.

 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header.
3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
4. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with information about the team, such as the list of agents in the team and their current state.
