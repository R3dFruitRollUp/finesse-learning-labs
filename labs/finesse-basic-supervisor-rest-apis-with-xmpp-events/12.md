## Step 12: Supervisor logs out userA

Supervisors can log out agents who belong to their team. A supervisor can log out an agent in READY, NOT_READY, RESERVED, RESERVED_OUTBOUND, RESERVED_OUTBOUND_PREVIEW, TALKING, HOLD, WORK, or WORK_READY state.

> Finesse API for supervisor logging out a user
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/User/{id_of_agent_on_team}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User - Change Agent State</a>

The supervisor logging out a user uses the same ``/User`` REST resource as the supervisor changing a user's state. The XML data in the request body will be:
```xml
<User>
     <state>LOGOUT</state>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter SupervisorA's username: ``{{supervisor_username}}``
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter SupervisorA's password: ``{{supervisor_password}}``
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
 ```xml
<User>
        <state>LOGOUT</state>
</User>
```

2. Click **Send** to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty Body textbox.

4. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should not see any notifications being sent from Finesse. This confirms that supervisorA has unsubscribed from the team notifications.
5. In **Chrome**, go to UserA's Finesse desktop window. You should see userA is signed out.
