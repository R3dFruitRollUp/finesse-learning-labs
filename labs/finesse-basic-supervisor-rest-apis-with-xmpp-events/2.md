## Step 2: Check that the Finesse system is in service

> Finesse API resource for getting the information about the Finesse system
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/SystemInfo
```
> For more details about /SystemInfo, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S6109343_00_systeminfo-get.html" target="_blank">SystemInfo - GET</a>

The ``/SystemInfo`` API response represents the Finesse system and includes the deployment type, the peripheral ID, the installed license, the current system state, the XMPP server and pubSub domains, and the hostnames of the primary and secondary Finesse nodes. This API is primarily used to check the status of the Finesse system. It is important to check the status of the system before using the Finesse REST APIs because the APIs will return an error if the system is out of service. Once the user is successfully logged in, it is no longer necessary to check the status of the system because the user will automatically receive a Finesse notification when the system goes out of service.

1. In **Chrome**, open a browser tab, click the **Apps** button on the shortcut toolbar and select **Postman**.
2. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
3. Construct a REST **GET** request for the `/SystemInfo` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/SystemInfo`` resource: ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/SystemInfo``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **GET**.

4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
5. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with the status of the Finesse system.

6. Confirm that the Finesse system is in service by looking at the `<status>` tag for **IN_SERVICE**. If the Finesse system is not IN_SERVICE, please work with the system administrator to get the system in service before proceeding.
