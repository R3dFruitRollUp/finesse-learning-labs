## Step 3: Sign in SupervisorA to the XMPP client

Finesse's REST API `PUT` and `POST` requests are asynchronous. A successful response is a HTTP return code of 200 or 202 with an empty response body. The updated object is sent as a Finesse notification via the Finesse Notification Service. In order to view these notifications without building an application, you will be using a XMPP client. The XMPP client is a tool to help simulate an application making a connection to the Finesse Notification Service. In a production application, you will need to use a [XMPP library](http://xmpp.org/software/libraries.html).

In this step, you will be signing in SupervisorA to the XMPP client in order to receive notifications by making a connection to the Finesse Notification Service.

If you are using a **Windows** workstation:
1. You will be using the following agent credentials for SupervisorA:
 * **Username**: ``{{supervisor_username}}``
 * **Password**: ``{{supervisor_password}}``
 * **Extension**: ``{{supervisor_dn}}``
2. In **Pidgin**, go to Accounts -> Manage Accounts.

3. Delete any existing accounts.
 * Select the account(s) to be deleted.
 * Click the **Delete** button.

 * A confirmation window will pop up. Click the **Delete** button.

4. Add SupervisorA to the XMPP client.
 * Click the **Add** button on the Accounts window.
 * On the Add Account window, for the **Protocol** value, select XMPP.
 * For the **Username** value, enter SupervisorA's username: ``{{supervisor_username}}``.
 * For the **Domain** value, enter ``abc.inc``.
 * For the **Resource** value, enter any text.
 * For the **Password** value, enter SupervisorA's password: ``{{supervisor_password}}``.

 * Click the **Advanced** tab.
 * For the **Connection Security** value, select **Use encryption if available**.
 * Select the checkbox to **Allow plaintext auth over unencrypted streams**.
 * For the **Connect server**, enter the Finesse FQDN: ``{{web-url}}``.

 * Click the **Add** button.
5. Verify that SupervisorA is signed in to the XMPP client by confirming the **Available** status. If the status is not **Available**, repeat steps 2-4.

6. Open the XMPP Console. Go to Tools -> XMPP Console -> XMPP Console.

7. A XMPP Console window will appear. This is where you will see the Finesse notifications. Do note that there will be other events, such as user presence, that will appear in this window. This can be ignored.
