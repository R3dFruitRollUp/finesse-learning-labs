## Step 4: Upload the gadget to a web server

In order to add custom (third-party) gadgets to the Finesse out of the box agent desktop, you must host them on a web server. As mentioned in the previous step, you can upload your gadgets to the Finesse server, but it is not mandatory. You can use your own web server as long as it is accessible by both the Finesse server and the agent workstation.

For this lab, we will be using the Finesse server to host the gadget. Finesse allows one user, the 3rdpartygadget user, to upload gadgets to the /files directory on the Finesse server using secure FTP (SFTP). The 3rdpartygadget account only has permission to this directory and any directories created under it. In order to use the 3rdpartygadget account to upload gadgets using SFTP, you must set the password for this account via CLI (command line interface). For more details about the 3rdpartygadget account, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#enable-or-reset-3rdpartygadget-account" target="_blank">Password for 3rdpartygadget Account</a>.

Enabling the 3rdpartygadget account only needs to be done once per install. You may skip this section if you have already done it from a different Finesse lab for this particular sandbox instance. If you are unsure, just continue with this step as it does not hurt to repeat it.

### Enable the 3rdpartygadget account

1. Establish establish a SSH session with the Finesse server.
 * Open **PuTTY**, a SSH client.
 * For the **Host Name (or IP address)**, enter the Finesse FQDN: ``{{web-url}}``.
 * If the **Port** is blank, enter ``22``.
 * Click **Open**.

     ![PuTTY Login](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/putty-login.jpg)
 * If the PuTTY Security Alert window appears, click **Yes**.

     ![PuTTY Security Alert](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/putty-security-alert.jpg)
 * In the terminal window that opens, for **login as**, enter ``{{admin_username}}``.
 * For **{{admin_username}}@{{web-url}}'s password**, enter ``{{admin_password}}``.

     ![PuTTY Terminal Login](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/putty-terminal-login.jpg)
 * You will see the Finesse server Platform Command Line Interface.

1. Set the 3rdpartygadget account password.
 * In the Platform Command Line Interface, enter the CLI to change the password:

     ``utils reset_3rdpartygadget_password``
 * For **New Password**, enter ``ciscocisco``.
 * For **Confirm New Password**, enter ``ciscocisco``.
 * If the password was set successfully, you will see the text "Password updated successfully.".

     ![PuTTY Terminal CLI](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/putty-terminal-cli.jpg)
 * If you get an error that there is a password mismatch, repeat the step and type the passwords slowly.

**Note**: The password for the 3rdpartygadget account must be between 5 and 32 characters long and must not contain spaces or double quotes (").

### Upload the sample gadget

1. Upload the sample gadget to the Finesse server.
 * Open **FileZilla**, a SFTP client.
 * In the quickconnect bar,
     * For the **Host**, enter the Finesse FQDN: ``{{web-url}}``.
     * For the **Username**, enter ``3rdpartygadget``.
     * For the **Password**, enter the password of the 3rdpartygadget (from the previous step): ``ciscocisco``.
     * For the **Port**, enter the port of the Finesse server: ``22``.
 * Click **Quickconnect**.

     ![FileZilla Connection Info](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/filezilla-connect.jpg)

 * If a **Remember Passwords?** window appears,
     * Select **Do not save passwords**.
     * Click **OK**.
 * An **Unknown host key** window will appear.
     * Select **Always trust this host, add this key to the cache**.
     * Click **OK**.
 * Verify that the connection was successful.
     * In the message log section, confirm that you see a line that says:

      **Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected to {{web-url}}**.
     * In the remote site section, confirm that you see a folder named **/** and you can see the **files** folder below.

     ![FileZilla Connected](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/filezilla-connected.jpg)
 * Transfer the HelloWorld.xml file.
     * Drag the HelloWorld.xml file into the files folder.
     * Confirm that the transfer was successful by checking that the transfers shows up in the **Successful transfers** tab at the bottom.

     ![FileZilla Successful Transfer](/posts/files/finesse-hello-world-gadget/assets/images/filezilla-successful-transfer-helloWorld.jpg)
1. Confirm that you can access the gadget.
 * In **Chrome**, open a browser tab, and enter the following URL: <a href="https://{{web-url}}:8445/3rdpartygadget/files/HelloWorld.xml" target="_blank">https://{{web-url}}:8445/3rdpartygadget/files/HelloWorld.xml</a>
 * If the sample gadget was uploaded successfully, you will see content of the HelloWorld.xml file in the browser window.
