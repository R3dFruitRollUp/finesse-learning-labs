## Lab overview
In this lab, you will learn about Finesse gadgets. Next, you will apply that knowledge to building a simple Hello World gadget, upload it to the Finesse 3rdpartygadget web server and add it to the Finesse agent desktop. Then, you will view it in the Finesse out of the box agent desktop.

## Step 1: Finesse Gadgets Overview
Finesse gadgets are made up of three types of files:

* **XML**: Contains the data and code for the gadget. The XML file contains instructions on how to process and render the gadget. This would include the HTML mark up for the format of the gadget, just like a regular webpage.
* **JavaScript**: Contains the business logic for the gadget. JavaScript is a scripting language that make webpages interactive by allowing developers to add dynamic behavior to the gadget.
* **CSS**: Contains the styling of the gadget.

Together, these files are uploaded to a web server (third-party or the Finesse server) so that they can be added to the Finesse agent desktop.
