Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction.
