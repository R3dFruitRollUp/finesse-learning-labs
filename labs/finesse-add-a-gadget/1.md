## Cisco Finesse
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction. Finesse comes with an out-of-the box agent and supervisor desktop as well as REST APIs and a JavaScript Library API. Developers can easily integrate contact center features into their existing applications by utilizing the Finesse REST APIs. Or, they can use the Finesse JavaScript Library API to integrate their existing applications (via gadgets) into the Finesse agent and supervisor desktop.

## Finesse JavaScript APIs
Cisco Finesse provides JavaScript APIs for building custom gadgets for the Finesse Desktop. The JavaScript APIs are built on top of the Finesse REST APIs and are easy to use. They are even used in the Finesse out-of-the-box agent desktop. For more details about the individual APIs, see the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#javascript-library" target="_blank">Finesse JavaScript Library documentation</a>.
