## Step 2: Enable the 3rdpartygadget account

Finesse provides a mechanism for you to upload third-party gadgets to the Finesse server. This mechanism allows one user, the 3rdpartygadget user, to upload gadgets to the /files directory on the Finesse server using secure FTP (SFTP). The 3rdpartygadget account only has permission to this directory and any directories created under it. In order to use the 3rdpartygadget account to upload gadgets using SFTP, you must set the password for this account via CLI (command line interface). For more details about the 3rdpartygadget account, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#enable-or-reset-3rdpartygadget-account" target="_blank">Password for 3rdpartygadget account</a>.

Note: This step only needs to be completed once per installation. You may skip this step if you have already completed it from a different Finesse lab for this particular sandbox instance. If you are unsure, continue with this step as it does not hurt to repeat it.

1. Establish a SSH session with the Finesse server,
 * Open **PuTTY**, a SSH client.
 * Enter the Finesse FQDN  ``{{web-url}}``in the **Host Name (or IP address)** field.
 * Click **Open**.

1. Set the 3rdpartygadget account password.
 * In the Platform Command Line Interface, enter the following to change the password: ``utils reset_3rdpartygadget_password``.
 * Enter ``ciscocisco`` for the **New Password** and again for **Confirm New Password**.
 * If the password is successfully set, you will see "Password updated successfully."

 * If you get an error that there is a password mismatch, redo this step and type the passwords slowly.
