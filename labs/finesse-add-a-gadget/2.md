## Step 2: Enable the 3rdpartygadget account

Finesse provides a mechanism for you to upload third-party gadgets to the Finesse server. This mechanism allows one user, the 3rdpartygadget user, to upload gadgets to the /files directory on the Finesse server using secure FTP (SFTP). The 3rdpartygadget account only has permission to this directory and any directories created under it. In order to use the 3rdpartygadget account to upload gadgets using SFTP, you must set the password for this account via CLI (command line interface). For more details about the 3rdpartygadget account, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#enable-or-reset-3rdpartygadget-account" target="_blank">Password for 3rdpartygadget Account</a>.

This step only needs to be done once per install. You may skip this step if you have already done it from a different Finesse lab for this particular sandbox instance. If you are unsure, just continue with this step as it does not hurt to repeat it.

1. Establish a SSH session with the Finesse server.
 * Open **PuTTY**, a SSH client.
 * For the **Host Name (or IP address)**, enter the Finesse FQDN: ``{{web-url}}``.
 * Click the **Open** button.

 * A terminal window will open.
 * In the terminal window, for **login as**, enter ``{{admin_username}}``.
 * For **{{admin_username}}@{{web-url}}'s password**, enter ``{{admin_password}}``.

     ![PuTTY Terminal Login](/posts/files/finesse-add-a-gadget/assets/images/putty-terminal-login.jpg)
 * You will see the Finesse server Platform Command Line Interface.

     ![PuTTY Terminal CLI Interface](/posts/files/finesse-add-a-gadget/assets/images/putty-terminal-cli-interface.jpg)

1. Set the 3rdpartygadget account password.
 * In the Platform Command Line Interface, enter the CLI to change the password:

    ``utils reset_3rdpartygadget_password``
 * For **New Password**, enter ``ciscocisco``.
 * For **Confirm New Password**, enter ``ciscocisco``.
 * If the password was set successfully, you will see the text "Password updated successfully.".

 * If you get an error that there is a password mismatch, redo this step and type the passwords slowly.
