## Step 3: Upload the sample gadget

Finesse gadgets are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSocial" target="_blank">OpenSocial</a> gadgets. An OpenSocial Gadget is an XML document that defines metadata for an OpenSocial Gadget container, the Finesse agent desktop. Gadgets are highly cacheable so it does not need a high-performance server.

A gadget consists of the following:
 * XML to define metadata
 * HTML for markup
 * JavaScript for interactivity
 * CSS for presentation & style

For more information about gadgets, go to the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#finesse-gadgets" target="_blank">Finesse Gadgets</a> section in the Finesse Developer Guide.

In order to add custom (third-party) gadgets to the Finesse out-of-the-box agent desktop, you must host them on a web server. As mentioned in the previous step, you can upload your gadgets to the Finesse server, but it is not mandatory. You can use your own web server as long as it is accessible by both the Finesse server and the agent workstation. For more information about uploading third-party gadgets, go to the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#upload-third-party-gadgets" target="_blank">Upload Third-Party Gadgets</a> section in the Finesse Developer Guide.
