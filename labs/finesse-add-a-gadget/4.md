## Step 4: Add the gadget to the agent's desktop layout

Finesse provides the ability to have a different desktop layout between agents and supervisors. The Finesse admin can also define how many tabs per layout, columns per tab, and gadgets per column. Each tab and/or column can be unique. In addition to the flexibility of the desktop layout, Finesse allows a different desktop layout to be defined per team. This allows the agents and supervisors to have a custom experience in order to provide the best customer support.
