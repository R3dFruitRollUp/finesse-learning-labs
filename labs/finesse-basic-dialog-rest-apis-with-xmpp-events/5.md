## Step 5: UserA calls UserC

Calls are the core of a contact center and the agent's day-to-day activities. In Finesse, calls are represented as a dialog with a mediaType of *Voice*. Finesse simplifies making a call into one REST API request.

> Finesse API for making a call
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}/Dialogs
```
> For more details about User's /Dialogs, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_DC4120C3_00_dialog-create-a-new-dialog.html" target="_blank">Dialog â€” Create a New Dialog (Make a Call)</a>

Making a call still uses the ``/User`` REST resource because it an action on the user and the dialog collection belongs to the user. It uses the HTTP ``POST`` verb since it is an adding a call to the dialog collection. For this request, we need to provide extra information about the call (i.e. recipient of the call), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<Dialog>
   <requestedAction>MAKE_CALL</requestedAction>
   <fromAddress>[UserA's Extension]</fromAddress>
   <toAddress>[UserC's Extension]</toAddress>
</Dialog>
```

In this step, userA will make a direct call to userC. For the purposes of this lab, userC's phone has been configured to automatically answer calls. Therefore, userA's call will be answered immediately by userC.

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **POST** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}/Dialogs``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **POST**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, then select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appears.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``.
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML dialog data:
 ```xml
<Dialog>
        <requestedAction>MAKE_CALL</requestedAction>
        <fromAddress>{{agentA_dn}}</fromAddress>
        <toAddress>{{agentC_dn}}</toAddress>
</Dialog>
```

2. Click **Send** to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

4. UserC's phone automatically answers the call.
5. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should see a number of notifications being sent from Finesse.
 * There should be a dialog notification with the ``<source>`` tag value of /finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}/Dialogs and the ``<event>`` tag value of POST. This confirms that the user has a new dialog.

 * There should be one or more dialog notifications with the ``<source>`` tag value of /finesse/api/Dialog/{dialogId}. These are updates to the call, such as the participant's state and allowable actions.

 * Since userC automatically answered the call, one of the dialog notifications will have a ``<state>`` tag value of ACTIVE. Both userA's and userC's participant ``<state>`` tag value are also ACTIVE, which confirms that userC answered the call. The participant state describes the state of the user's device for this call. A full list of participant states can be found in the [Finesse Developer Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_SA5F5404_00_state-participant-parameter-values.html).

6. The value of the ``<id>`` tag in this notification is the dialog Id used to perform additional actions on this call (e.g. answer, hold, end, etc.). Copy the value of the ``<id>`` tag from the dialog notification to a text editor.

7. Notice that both userA and userC's state as well as their list of actions have changed from the previous notification. This list is the participant's allowable actions and it contains the actions that the device/user can perform at this stage of the call. Any action that is not on the list will result in an error. A full list of allowable actions can be found in the [Finesse Developer Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_A5DE755F_00_actions-parameter-values.html). In this step, you can see that both userA and userC can start a consult call, put the call on hold, update the call variables, send DTMF, start a recording, and end the call. Note that the allowable actions are not always the same for both parties of the call.
