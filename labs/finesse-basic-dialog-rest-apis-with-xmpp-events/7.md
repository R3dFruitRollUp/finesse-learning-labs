## Step 7: UserA ends the call

Ending the call is just another action on a participant so it will use the same REST API as the previous step but with an action of DROP.

> Finesse API for ending the call
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/Dialog/{dialogId}
```
> For more details about /Dialog, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/cfin_r_dialog-take-action-on-participants-11-5.html" target="_blank">Dialog — Take Action on Participant</a>

For this request, we need to provide the DROP action in the request Body:
```xml
<Dialog>
	<targetMediaAddress>[UserA's extension]</targetMediaAddress>
	<requestedAction>DROP</requestedAction>
</Dialog>
```

In this step, you will have UserA end the call and expect a DELETE Finesse notification to represent that the call has ended.

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/Dialog`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/Dialog`` resource where {dialogId} is the call's id that you had copied to the text editor in Step 5:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/Dialog/{dialogId}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``.
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML dialog data:
 ```xml
<Dialog>
        <targetMediaAddress>{{agentA_dn}}</targetMediaAddress>
        <requestedAction>DROP</requestedAction>
</Dialog>
```

2. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

4. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should see a number of notifications being sent from Finesse.
 * There should be a dialog notification with the ``<source>`` tag value of /finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}/Dialogs and the ``<event>`` tag value of DELETE. UserA's participant ``<state>`` tag value should be DROPPED. This confirms that UserA no longer has this dialog.
