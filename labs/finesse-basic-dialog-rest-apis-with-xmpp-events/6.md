## Step 6: UserA takes actions on a call

Once a call is established, you can perform any of the actions that are listed for your user/device. These actions are performed on the dialog object itself rather than the user object like in the previous steps.

> Finesse API for taking an action on a participant
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/Dialog/{dialogId}
```
> For more details about /Dialog, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/cfin_r_dialog-take-action-on-participants-11-5.html" target="_blank">Dialog â€” Take Action on Participant</a>

The dialog object represents a dialog with participants. For the media type "voice", this object represents a call and includes information about the call, such as the ANI (fromAddress), DNIS, callvariables, participants, call state, and allowable actions. Taking an action on a call uses the ``/Dialog`` REST resources with the HTTP ``PUT`` verb. To make this request, we need to provide some extra information such as the [action](https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_A5DE755F_00_actions-parameter-values.html) to be taken (i.e. ANSWER, HOLD, etc.), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<Dialog>
   <targetMediaAddress>[UserA's extension]</targetMediaAddress>
   <requestedAction>[Action]</requestedAction>
</Dialog>
```

In this step, userA will hold then retrieve the call using the Finesse REST API. You will receive Finesse notifications with UserA's participant state changing to HOLD and ACTIVE respectively.

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/Dialog`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/Dialog`` resource where {dialogId} is the call's id that you had copied to the text editor in the previous step:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/Dialog/{dialogId}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, then select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML dialog data:
 ```xml
<Dialog>
        <targetMediaAddress>{{agentA_dn}}</targetMediaAddress>
        <requestedAction>HOLD</requestedAction>
</Dialog>
```

2. Click **Send** to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

4. In **Pidgin**/**Adium**, on the XMPP/XML console, you should see a dialog notification being sent from Finesse with userA's participant ``<state>`` tag value of HELD. This confirms that userA put the call on hold.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 in this section to retrieve the call by using ``RETRIEVE`` as the action of the REST request and expecting userA's participant ``<state>`` tag value to be ACTIVE.
 ```xml
<Dialog>
        <targetMediaAddress>{{agentA_dn}}</targetMediaAddress>
        <requestedAction>RETRIEVE</requestedAction>
</Dialog>
```
