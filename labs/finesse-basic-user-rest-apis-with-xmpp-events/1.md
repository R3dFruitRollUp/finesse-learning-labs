# Finesse: Basic User REST APIs with XMPP Events#

## Objectives##

* Use the Finesse API to get information about the user.
* Use the Finesse API to login the user.
* Use the Finesse API to change the userâ€™s state.
* Use the Finesse API to log out the user.
* Get XMPP events (Finesse notifications) from Finesse as a result of the above API requests.

## Cisco Finesse
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center/Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction. Finesse comes with an out of the box agent and supervisor desktop as well as REST APIs and a JavaScript Library API. Developers can easily integrate contact center features into their existing applications by utilizing the Finesse REST APIs. Or, they can use the Finesse JavaScript Library API to integrate their existing applications (via gadgets) into the Finesse agent and supervisor desktop.

## Finesse REST APIs & XMPP events
Cisco Finesse provides REST APIs for performing agent and supervisor actions programmatically. These REST APIs are easy to use, modeled after HTTP, and works in thick and thin client integrations. These REST APIs are used to build the Finesse out of the box agent desktop. The <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/#rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> explains the details for each of the API's.

The Finesse REST API handles request/response, for example initiating a call or agent state change, but another important element of desktop functionality is processing of events. For example, when a call is sent to the agent, the Finesse Server needs to process the CTI Event and send the event to the client. Finesse uses BOSH/XMPP, an industry standard, to deliver this functionality. The specific events supported by Finesse are described in the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/#rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a>.

Here is an architectural view of the Finesse REST APIs and XMPP Events:
![Finesse XMPP Event Architecture](/posts/files/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis-with-xmpp-events/assets/images/finesse-eventing-architecture.jpg)

1. The client (thick or thin) makes Finesse REST API requests to perform agent and supervisor actions.
2. The Finesse Web Services receives the request, processes it, then makes a request via CTI message to the CTI Server.
3. The CTI Server processes the request, then sends a CTI event back to the Finesse Web Services as a result of the request.
4. The Finesse Web Services processes the CTI event, then sends a XMPP event to the Finesse Notification Service.
5. The Finesse Notification Service sends a XMPP event to the XMPP/BOSH connection from the client.

## Lab overview
In this lab, we will use the Google Chrome based REST test tool <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> to execute the Finesse REST APIs related to the dialog object. In addition to Postman, we will use a XMPP enabled chat client <a href="https://pidgin.im" target="_blank">Pidgin</a> for Windows or <a href="https://www.adium.im" target="_blank">Adium</a> for MacOS and to receive the XMPP events (notifications) from Finesse. These tools help simulate an application using Finesse REST APIs and notifications. In a production application, you will need to find a library to make REST requests and a [XMPP library](http://xmpp.org/software/libraries.html) to receive XMPP events. After completing this learning lab, you would have executed many iterations of the Finesse REST API & XMPP events roundtrip as seen in the architectual diagram above.

## Step 1: VPN to get access the Finesse server.

The Finesse server that you will be using for this learning lab is in a private network. In order to access the server, you will need to use VPN.

1. Open **Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client**.
2. Connect to the Finesse server by entering the lab's network address: ``{{vpn-url}}``.

3. Click **Connect**. A prompt requesting the username and password will appear.
4. For **username**, enter ``{{vpn-user}}``.
5. For **password**, enter ``{{vpn-password}}``.

6. Click **OK**.
