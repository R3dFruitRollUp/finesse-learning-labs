>  ```http

```

The User object represents an agent or supervisor and includes information about the user, such as roles, state, and teams.

1. You will be using the following agent credentials for UserA:
 * **Username**: ``{{agentA_username}}``
 * **Password**: ``{{agentA_password}}``
 * **Extension**: ``{{agentA_dn}}``
2. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click Reset to clear any previously entered data.
3. Construct a REST **GET** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
   ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **GET**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``

 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
4. Click **Send** to launch the request.
5. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with information about the user, such as user first name, last name, and user ``<state>`` tag value of LOGOUT.
