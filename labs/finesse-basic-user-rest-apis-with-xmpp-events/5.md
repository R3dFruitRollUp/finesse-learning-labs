## Step 5: Sign in UserA to Finesse

In contact center applications (Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise or Cisco Unified Contact Center Express), users have a notion of agent state. The agent's state represents the status of the agent, similar to the status in a chat client. Finesse follows the agent state transition machine that is defined in the contact center application that it is connected to. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User â€” Change Agent State</a> section of the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/#rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> for more information.

```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S21A5A70_00_sign-in.html" target="_blank">User - Sign In to Finesse</a>

Signing in the user uses the same ``/User`` REST resource, but this time via the HTTP ``PUT`` verb. In addition, we need to prove some extra information about the user (i.e. state and extension), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<User>
   <state>LOGIN</state>
   <extension>[User's Extension]</extension>
</User>
```

In this step, you will be signing in UserA using the Finesse REST API and expecting a Finesse notification with UserA in NOT_READY state.

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab. As suggested in the previous step, it is not recommended to click Reset.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
```xml
<User>
        <state>LOGIN</state>
        <extension>{{agentA_dn}}</extension>
</User>
```

3. Click **Send** to launch the request.
4. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

5. According to the agent state transition machine, when a user is successfully logged in, they will go to NOT_READY state. NOT_READY state means the user is logged in, but is not ready to take customer calls. In **Pidigin**, on the XMPP console, you should see a user notification being sent from Finesse with the ``<state>`` tag value of NOT_READY. This confirms that UserA was logged in successfully.
