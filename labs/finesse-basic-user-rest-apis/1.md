## Cisco Finesse
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center/Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction. Finesse comes with an out of the box agent and supervisor desktop as well as REST APIs and a JavaScript Library API. Developers can easily integrate contact center features into their existing applications by utilizing the Finesse REST APIs. Or, they can use the Finesse JavaScript Library API to integrate their existing applications (via gadgets) into the Finesse agent and supervisor desktop.

## Finesse REST APIs
Cisco Finesse provides REST APIs for performing agent and supervisor actions programmatically. These REST APIs are easy to use, modeled after HTTP, and works in thick and thin client integrations. These REST APIs are used to build the Finesse out of the box agent desktop. The <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/#rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> explains the details for each of the API's.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, we will use the Google Chrome based REST test tool <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> to execute the Finesse REST APIs related to the dialog object. This tool helps simulate an application using Finesse REST APIs. In a production application, you will need to find a library to make REST requests. By completing this learning lab, you will learn how to use the user related REST APIs.
