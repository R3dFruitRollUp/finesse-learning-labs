## Step 4: Sign in userA to Finesse

In contact center applications (Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise or Cisco Unified Contact Center Express), users have a notion of agent state. The agent's state represents the status of the agent, similar to the status in a chat client. Finesse follows the agent state transition machine that is defined in the contact center application that it is connected to. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User â€” Change Agent State</a> section of the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/finesse/docs/#rest-api-dev-guide" target="_blank">Finesse Developer Guide</a> for more information.

http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S21A5A70_00_sign-in.html" target="_blank">User - Sign In to Finesse</a>

Signing in the user uses the same ``/User`` REST resource, but this time via the HTTP ``PUT`` verb. In addition, we need to prove some extra information about the user (i.e. state and extension), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<User>
   <state>LOGIN</state>
   <extension>[User's Extension]</extension>
</User>
```

In this step, you will sign in UserA using the Finesse REST API and expect a Finesse notification with UserA in NOT_READY state.

1. Open a new tab in **Postman**. As suggested in the previous step, it is not recommended to click the Reset button.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
  ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
```xml
<User>
        <state>LOGIN</state>
        <extension>{{agentA_dn}}</extension>
</User>
```

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
4. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

5. According to the agent state transition machine, when a user is successfully logged in, they will go to NOT_READY state. NOT_READY state means the user is logged in, but is not ready to take customer calls. To confirm that the user was logged in successfully, use the GET user API from the **Step 3: Get UserA's information** section and verify that the ``<state>`` tag value is NOT_READY. If you kept the tab from Step 3 opened, switch back to that tab and click the **Send** button.
