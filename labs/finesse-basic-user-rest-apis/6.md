## Step 6: Sign out userA from Finesse

> Finesse API for signing out a user
>  ```http
http://<Finesse_FQDN>:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_SC0D86B5_00_sign-out-of-finesse.html" target="_blank">User - Sign Out of Finesse</a>

Signing out the user uses the same ``/User`` REST resource and HTTP **PUT** verb as the user change state API, but with different ``<state>`` value in the XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<User>
   <state>LOGOUT</state>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource:
   ``http://{{web-url}}:8082/finesse/api/User/{{agentA_username}}``.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, select **PUT**.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter UserA's username: ``{{agentA_username}}``.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter UserA's password: ``{{agentA_password}}``.
 * Click **Update request** to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * From the dropdown menu, select **XML (application/xml)**.
 * In the large body text box, put the following XML user data:
```xml
<User>
        <state>LOGOUT</state>
</User>
```

2. Click **Send** to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you will see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty body text box.

4. To confirm that the user was logged out successfully, use the GET user API from the **Step 3: Get the user information section** and verify that the ``<state>`` tag value is LOGOUT. If you kept the tab from Step 3 opened, switch back to that tab and click **Send**.
