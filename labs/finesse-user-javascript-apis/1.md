## Cisco Finesse
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop that is part of Cisco's Contact Center Customer Care solution suite. It is designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization. It helps improve the customer experience while offering a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction. Finesse comes with an out of the box agent and supervisor desktop as well as REST APIs and a JavaScript library API. Developers can easily integrate contact center features into their existing applications by utilizing the Finesse REST APIs. Or, they can use the Finesse JavaScript library API to integrate their existing applications (via gadgets) into the Finesse agent and supervisor desktop.

## Finesse JavaScript APIs
Cisco Finesse provides JavaScript APIs for building custom gadgets for the Finesse Desktop. These JavaScript APIs are built on top of the Finesse REST APIs and are easy to use. They are even used in the Finesse out of the box agent desktop. For more details about the individual APIs, see the <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#javascript-library" target="_blank">Finesse JavaScript library documentation</a>.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will be building a gadget using the finesse.restservices.User APIs and User notifications. Then, you will upload it to the Finesse 3rdpartygadget web server and add it to the Finesse Agent Desktop to view the gadget you just built.

## Step 1: Setting up your Workspace
Most developers do not build a Finesse third-party gadget from scratch. Cisco provides <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#sample-gadgets" target="_blank">sample gadgets</a> that are typically used as a base of custom gadgets. For this learning lab, you will be using a very plain base gadget so that you can learn how to use the User object. Most of the sample gadgets already has this built in.

1. Download the [base gadget](/posts/files/finesse-user-javascript-apis/assets/files/LearningLabSampleGadget-Finesse-11.5.1.zip).
1. Unzip the base gadget you downloaded. There should be 2 folders with 3 files each:
 * LearningLabSampleGadget-Finesse-11.5.1/
     * LearningLabSampleGadget/
 	     * SampleGadget.css
 	     * SampleGadget.js
 	     * SampleGadget.xml
     * LearningLabSampleGadget_Final/
	     * SampleGadget.css
	     * SampleGadget.js
	     * SampleGadget.xml

1. Open the LearningLabSampleGadget folder.
1. Using your favorite text editor, open all 3 files in the folder.
1. You are now ready to build your gadget.
