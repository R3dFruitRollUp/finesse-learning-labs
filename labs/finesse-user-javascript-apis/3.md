## Step 3: Laying down the groundwork for the gadget

In this step, you are going to populate the init method. This function is called by the OpenSocial container, the Finesse Agent Desktop in this case, when the gadget connects to the PubSub messaging hub.

1. Go to the **SampleGadget.js** file in your text editor.
Just like the SampleGadget.xml file, the SampleGadget.js file is pretty bare too. 

1. The Finesse desktop container exposes the current gadget configuration, such as the id of the logged in user, to the Finesse JavaScript library via the finesse.gadget.Config object. In the init function, declare the config object as a local variable so that you can access the configuration information:

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">init : function () {
		<span style="color:red">var cfg = finesse.gadget.Config;</span>
    }</code>
</pre>

 Since this config object is only used within the init function, it is being declared as a local variable.

1. The Finesse JavaScript library provides the ClientServices class that allows gadgets to make API requests and consume the Finesse events that are already being sent to the container (Finesse Agent Desktop). In order for your gadget to receive these events and make REST API requests, you must initialize the ClientServices class, which can be done in a single line of code!

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">init : function () {
	   var cfg = finesse.gadget.Config;

	   <span style="color:red">finesse.clientservices.ClientServices.init(cfg);</span>
    }</code>
</pre>

1. As a best practice, it is always recommended to have client logging for the gadget. It will make it easier to debug issues when they arise in production, especially for unreproducible issues.
 * Declare the clientLogs as a global variable. You want it to be a global variable so that you can use it throughout the JavaScript file.
 * Initialize the clientLogs by passing it the gadget hub, a gadgetId, and the config object. The gadgetId string will be automatically prefixed to each log statement.
 
 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">finesse.modules.SampleGadget = (function ($) {
	    <span style="color:red">var clientLogs;</span>

	    /** @scope finesse.modules.SampleGadget */
	    return {
	        /**
	         * Performs all initialization for this gadget
	         */
	        init : function () {
				var cfg = finesse.gadget.Config;
				
				finesse.clientservices.ClientServices.init(cfg);

				<span style="color:red">clientLogs = finesse.cslogger.ClientLogger;
            	clientLogs.init(gadgets.Hub, "SampleGadget", cfg);</span>
			}
	    };
    }(jQuery));</code>
</pre>

1. The Finesse JavaScript library also provides a container-level service, ContainerServices, that exposes container events, and allows the gadget to utilize the container dialogs and event handling.
 * In order to use these utilities, you must initialize the ContainerServices class.
 * Then, add a handler for when the tab is visible. This is needed because there will be some business logic later where the HTML of the gadget is modified and uses the gadget adjustHeight method to resize the gadget. The adjustHeight method only works when the tab is visible, so it is best to re-adjust the height of the gadget when it is visible just in case there were HTML changes made when the tab was not visible.
 * Lastly, it is recommended to call the `containerServices.makeActiveTabReq()` method after adding a handler to ensure the gadget gets properly initialized.

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">init : function () {
    	var cfg = finesse.gadget.Config;
    
    	finesse.clientservices.ClientServices.init(cfg);
    
    	clientLogs = finesse.cslogger.ClientLogger;
    	clientLogs.init(gadgets.Hub, "SampleGadget", cfg);
    
    	<span style="color:red">containerServices = finesse.containerservices.ContainerServices.init();
    	containerServices.addHandler(finesse.containerservices.ContainerServices.Topics.ACTIVE_TAB, function() {
            clientLogs.log("Gadget is now visible");
            gadgets.window.adjustHeight();
        });
    
        containerServices.makeActiveTabReq();</span>
    }</code>
</pre>
