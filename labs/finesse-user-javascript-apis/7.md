# Step 7: Upload the gadget to a web server

In order to add custom (third-party) gadgets to the Finesse out of the box agent desktop, you must host them on a web server. As mentioned in the previous step, you can upload your gadgets to the Finesse server, but it is not mandatory. You can use your own web server as long as it is accessible by both the Finesse server and the agent workstation.

For this lab, we will be using the Finesse server to host the gadget. Finesse allows one user, the 3rdpartygadget user, to upload gadgets to the /files directory on the Finesse server using secure FTP (SFTP). The 3rdpartygadget account only has permission to this directory and any directories created under it. In order to use the 3rdpartygadget account to upload gadgets using SFTP, you must set the password for this account via CLI (command line interface). For more details about the 3rdpartygadget account, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#enable-or-reset-3rdpartygadget-account" target="_blank">Password for 3rdpartygadget Account</a>.

### Enable the 3rdpartygadget account

1. Establish establish a SSH session with the Finesse server.
 * Open **PuTTY**, a SSH client.
 * For the **Host Name (or IP address)**, enter the Finesse FQDN: ``{{web-url}}``.
 * If the **Port** is blank, enter ``22``.
