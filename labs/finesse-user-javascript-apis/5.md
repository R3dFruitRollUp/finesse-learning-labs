# Step 5: Getting user data

Now that you've completed the groundwork and have the user object, getting the user data is very simple.

In the previous step, you created the empty onLoad and the onChange handler functions. But, what should happen in these handlers? In this case, your gadget will mimic the Finesse Agent Desktop where it will blindly display all of the User data on the gadget instead of finding and updating only the delta between the current and previous event. So, as a result, both handlers (onLoad and onChange) will do the same thing.

If you are building a more sophisticated gadget or dealing with a more complex scenario, here are some tips:

* Any code that is User related that you want to call one time should go in the onLoad handler.
* Any code where you want to trigger on a user change should go in the onChange handler. For example, if you want to perform an action when the agent's state goes from READY to NOT_READY, then you would put the if condition and code in the onChange handler.

Since both handlers will do the same thing, let's build a function that will take the user data and display the current values on the gadget.

1. Create the function that will populate the gadget.

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">finesse.modules.SampleGadget = (function ($) {
	    var clientLogs, user,

	    <span style="color:red">populateGadget = function () { },</span>

	    handleUserLoad = function (userevent) { },

	    handleUserChange = function(userevent) { };

	    ...
    }(jQuery));</code>
</pre>
1. Fill in the values of the fields in the XML/HTML of the gadget.

 Remember the ClientServices that you initiated in the beginning? Well, the clientServices work behind the scenes and processes all the notifications that it receives. What that means is that whenever it gets a User notification, it will update the user object with the latest data. As a result, you do not have to worry about parsing the notification or XML data. So, to get the current user data values, all you have to do is call the JavaScript get methods on the User object.

 In the code below, it is setting the user values to the text of the specified id of the HTML. This is very standard way to change text of the HTML using JavaScript.

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">populateGadget = function () {
        <span style="color:red">var currentState = user.getState();

        $("#userId").text(user.getId());
        $("#firstName").text(user.getFirstName());
        $("#lastName").text(user.getLastName());
        if (user.hasSupervisorRole()) {
            $("#userRole").text('Supervisor');
        } else {
            $("#userRole").text('Agent');
        }
        $("#extension").text(user.getExtension());
        $("#userState").text(currentState);
        $("#teamId").text(user.getTeamId());
        $("#teamName").text(user.getTeamName());</span>
    },</code>
</pre>

1. Whenever you make changes to the HTML, it is best practice to call the `adjustHeight` function so that the gadget can re-adjust the height to avoid any content from being cut off or even having extra whitespace.

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">populateGadget = function () {
        var currentState = user.getState();

        $("#userId").text(user.getId());
        $("#firstName").text(user.getFirstName());
        $("#lastName").text(user.getLastName());
        if (user.hasSupervisorRole()) {
            $("#userRole").text('Supervisor');
        } else {
            $("#userRole").text('Agent');
        }
        $("#extension").text(user.getExtension());
        $("#userState").text(currentState);
        $("#teamId").text(user.getTeamId());
        $("#teamName").text(user.getTeamName());

        <span style="color:red">gadgets.window.adjustHeight();</span>
    },</code>
</pre>

1. Lastly, in the two handlers, call the function you just wrote. This means that this method gets called when the User object is loaded as well as when there is a change in the user data.

 <pre>
    <code class="lang-none">handleUserChange = function(userevent) {
    	<span style="color:red">populateGadget();</span>
    },

    handleUserLoad = function (userevent) {
    	<span style="color:red">populateGadget();</span>
    };</code>
</pre>
